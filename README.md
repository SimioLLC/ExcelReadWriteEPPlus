This is a Simio user extension that adds two steps:
1. ExcelReadEPPlus, and
2. ExcelWriteEPPlus

They function the same as the original Excel Read/Write, but use the open source EPPlus package instead of the DevExpress (which is what the embedded steps employ).

This version is in early beta, with the Write being tested, and the Read just starting.
The documentation is not finished.
